# Kodi CatBackup

This is a Kodi backup plugin — but with cat themes.

Kodi is complex. Maintaining multiple Kodi instances even moreso. Handling regressions from Kodi version updates can be a disaster.

This is a forked implementation of the original `xbmcbackup` add-on that fixes bugs, cleans up code, and more importantly adds really important backup feature and capabilities.

# What's new?

- Keeps backups classed by Kodi version to allow for easier rollbacks and migrations when dealing with new Kodi versions.

## Thanks

Forked from [xbmcbackup](https://github.com/robweber/xbmcbackup). Many thanks to `robweber` and the many contributors that project.
